:: GNU :: MSYS2 ::
==================

# 1. Overview

This document acts as a quick guide for installing and using [MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io/) on Windows 7 ( 64 bits ).

## 1.1. Goals & Objectives

> MSYS2 is an independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software.

> The name is a contraction of Minimal SYStem 2, and aims to provide support to facilitate using the bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.

The default terminal emulator is [mintty](https://code.google.com/p/mintty/).
