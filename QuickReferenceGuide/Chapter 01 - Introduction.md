Quick Reference Guide
=====================

# 1. Introduction

> Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Follow the [QuickInstallationGuide](Chapter 00 - Installation.md) to have a fully working Python development environment on Windows or Linux or MacOS.

## 1.1. Roots

Guido van Rossum, from Netherlands, conceived the language in late 1980s and the implementation started in December 1989. Although the name of the language is usually associated with an animal it turns out that Guido named Python after the television series Monthy Python's Flying Circus.

The language is a successor of ABC, which was inspired by SETL and also builds on concepts from Modula-3.

## 1.2. Recent History

- Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, and included many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed;
- Python 3.0 ( also called Python 3000 or py3k ), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.

## 1.3. Authors

[Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), born in 31st January 1956, is a Dutch programmer that decided to work on Christmas hobby project. This project was later called Python.

> In the Python community, Van Rossum is known as a "Benevolent Dictator For Life" ( BDFL ), meaning that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary. He was employed by Google from 2005 until 7 December 2012, where he spent half his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, Van Rossum started working for Dropbox.

## 1.4. Why?

- Methods can have arguments with default values and a variable number of arguments;
- Thoroughly object-oriented with inheritance, ~~mixins~~ and metaclasses;
- Four levels of variable scope ( global, class, instance, and local )~~, denoted by _sigils_ ( $, @ ) or the lack thereof~~;
- Dynamic reflection and alteration of objects to facilitate metaprogramming;

- **Open Source**.

## 1.6. Style Guides

The official coding style is [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) - Style Guide for Python Code. This document and [PEP 0257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) - Docstring Conventions - were adapted from Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry's style guide.

This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

Google also has an official [Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

## 1.7. Official Documentation

The official documentation is split in two versions:

- [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2/) - currently at 2.7;
- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) - currently at 3.4.
